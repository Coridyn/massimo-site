Pages are the building blocks of a **massimo** site. Each page is built of two parts, the [metadata](/metadata/) section (which is optional) and the content of the page.

A page file can be any format recognized by [Tilt](http://github.com/rtomayko/tilt). For example, [this site](http://github.com/petebrowne/massimo-site/tree/master/pages) uses Markdown files for pages.
