A **massimo** project looks something like this, though each directory's path can be customized.

    my-site/
      config.rb
      helpers/
      javascripts/
        main.js
      lib/
      pages/
        index.haml
      public/
      stylesheets/
        main.sass
      views/
         layouts/
           main.haml
           
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>config.rb</th>
      <td>The project's <a href="/massimo/config/">config file</a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>helpers</th>
      <td>This is where you put helper modules (like Rails). This modules will automatically be available in your pages and views.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>javascripts</th>
      <td>This is where you put the working copies of your javascripts. They will be concatenated, minified, and moved to your output directory when the site is processed.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>lib</th>
      <td>This is where you put additional libraries. This is where you would add additional Tilt&nbsp;Templates.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>pages</th>
      <td>These are the actual pages (content) of your site. Anything here that is registered by a Tilt Template will be transformed into HTML and moved to the appropriate place in the output&nbsp;directory.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>public</th>
      <td>By default, this is where your site will be built.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>stylesheets</th>
      <td>This is where you put the working copies of your stylesheets. If they are Sass or Less documents, they will be transformed into CSS documents then moved to your output&nbsp;directory.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>views</th>
      <td>This is where you put partials and layouts (like Rails). You can render partials from your pages by calling <code>render('partial_name')</code>.</td>
    </tr>
